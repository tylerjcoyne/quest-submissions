**(1) What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**

1. Safety & Security: Cadence is committed to scaling efficiencies in a manner that _doesn't_ compromise how safe it is to read & write Smart Contracts.
2. Clarity: Cadence is intended to be easy-to-read, so that users executing smart contracts are fully aware of that code's contents & functionality. This is intended to protect users.
3. Approachability: Cadence looks familiar to other programming languages, and employes many of the same basic design concepts. This eases the onboarding for developers interested in joining the FLOW fam.
4. Developer Experience: Cadence developers shouldn't feel frustrated by the process of debugging their code. Error messages should be easy to follow and resolve.
5. Resource Oriented Programming: Whereas some languages use Object Oriented Programming, Cadence employs **Resource** Oriented Programming. These Resources are at the core of everything done on FLOW.

**(2) In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?**

- It sounds to me like these are useful principles because they strike at the core of every frustrating aspect of programming that I've ever experienced. I've been hacked, struggled to onboard from one language to another, not known how to read code, and been frustrated by confusing error messages that I couldn't resolve. The pillars are clearly striving to kickstart a new "norm" via the Cadence language, and since FLOW will one day be fully decentralized, it's also very important that everyone contributing to the ecosystem is on the same page, because there can be no central entity overseeing the process of language development.
