**(1) What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**

- 1. Safety & Security: Cadence is committed to scaling efficiencies in a manner that _doesn't_ compromise how safe it is to read & write Smart Contracts.
- 2. Clarity: Cadence is intended to be easy-to-read, so that users executing smart contracts are fully aware of that code's contents & functionality. This is intended to protect users.
- 3. Approachability: Cadence looks familiar to other programming languages, and employes many of the same basic design concepts. This eases the onboarding for developers interested in joining the FLOW fam.
- 4. Developer Experience: Cadence developers shouldn't feel frustrated by the process of debugging their code. Error messages should be easy to follow and resolve.
- 5. Resource Oriented Programming: Whereas some languages use Object Oriented Programming, Cadence employs **Resource** Oriented Programming. These Resources are at the core of everything done on FLOW.

**(2) In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?**
