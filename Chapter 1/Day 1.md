**(1) Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.**

- The blockchain is a decentralized network of computer "nodes" that's used to store data on a publicly-accessible, immutable ledger. Its specific point of differentiation from a more traditional Server/Cloud setup is that is the fact that it's **decentralized**. This indicates that no single entity "owns" it, so there would be no way for a central party (e.g. Amazon) to wipe out the network overnight. It _also_ means that if one "node" on the blockchain is taken out, it won't impact the network's storage as a whole, because there are still X nodes globally helping to maintain the Blockchain. Blockchains are also public by nature, meaning that anyone can view its stored data at any time. 

**(2) Explain what a Smart Contract is.**

- "Smart Contract" refers to the code that's used to specify functionality for a specific fraction of the Blockchain. For example, if you'd like to send cryptocurrency from your wallet to a friends, there's a Smart Contract written for that action, which will specify what you **can** and **can't** do as part of that process. Smart contracts are also used to help establish rules surrounding Decentralized Apps (maintaining order in an otherwise lawless Web3 society).

**(3) Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.**

- A **transaction** refers to any time that an action is taken to make a **change** to the blockchain. For example, in the same example where I'm sending FLOW tokens to a friend, this would require me to occupy space on the blockchain, and so that transaction would be written to the chain, which incurs gas fees in the process.

- By contrast, a **script** refers simply to any time that an action is taken to **view** a blockchain's existing data. No new data is written, and therefore no gas fees are incurred.
